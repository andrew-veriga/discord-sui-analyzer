# Database Connection Error Fix

## Problem
The application was experiencing `sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError: (psycopg2.OperationalError) SSL SYSCALL error: EOF detected` errors that were crashing the entire service. This is a common PostgreSQL connection issue that occurs when:

- Network connectivity is unstable
- SSL connections are improperly configured
- Database connections timeout or are unexpectedly closed
- Connection pool is exhausted or corrupted

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Database Service (`app/services/database.py`)

#### Connection Retry Logic
- **Exponential Backoff**: Implements exponential backoff with jitter to avoid thundering herd problems
- **Connection Error Detection**: Automatically detects connection-related errors that should trigger retries
- **Automatic Reconnection**: Recreates database connections when connection errors are detected
- **Configurable Retry Parameters**: Retry count, delays, and timeouts are configurable via `config.yaml`

#### Key Features Added:
```python
# Retry configuration
max_retries: 3
base_delay: 1.0  # seconds
max_delay: 60.0  # seconds

# Connection health monitoring
pool_pre_ping: True  # Verify connections before use
```

#### Connection Error Detection
The system now detects these connection errors and automatically retries:
- `SSL SYSCALL error: EOF detected`
- `Connection reset`
- `Connection refused`
- `Connection timeout`
- `Server closed the connection`
- `Connection lost`
- `Database is not accepting connections`

### 2. Improved SSL Configuration

#### SSL Mode Options
- **`prefer`** (default): Use SSL if available, but don't require it
- **`require`**: Require SSL connection
- **`disable`**: Disable SSL completely

#### Connection Arguments
```python
connect_args={
    'sslmode': 'prefer',
    'connect_timeout': 30,
    'application_name': 'discord-sui-analyzer'
}
```

### 3. Health Check System

#### Database Health Check
- **Connection Testing**: Performs `SELECT 1` to verify database connectivity
- **Pool Status Monitoring**: Tracks connection pool metrics
- **Health Endpoint**: Added `/health` endpoint to monitor database status

#### Health Check Response
```json
{
    "status": "healthy",
    "database": {
        "status": "healthy",
        "connection_test": true,
        "pool_status": {
            "size": 5,
            "checked_in": 4,
            "checked_out": 1,
            "overflow": 0,
            "invalid": 0
        }
    },
    "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

### 4. Configuration Updates (`configs/config.yaml`)

```yaml
database:
  url: "${PEERA_DB_URL}"
  pool_size: 5
  max_overflow: 10
  pool_timeout: 30
  pool_recycle: 3600
  # Connection retry settings
  max_retries: 3
  base_delay: 1.0
  max_delay: 60.0
  # SSL settings
  ssl_mode: "prefer"
  connect_timeout: 30
```

## How It Works

### 1. Connection Retry Flow
```
Database Operation Request
         ↓
   Create Session
         ↓
   Operation Fails?
         ↓ (Yes)
   Is Connection Error?
         ↓ (Yes)
   Retry Count < Max?
         ↓ (Yes)
   Wait (Exponential Backoff)
         ↓
   Test Connection Health
         ↓
   Reconnect if Needed
         ↓
   Retry Operation
         ↓
   Success or Max Retries Reached
```

### 2. Error Handling Strategy
- **Immediate Retry**: For connection errors with exponential backoff
- **Connection Health Check**: Before each retry attempt
- **Automatic Reconnection**: Recreates engine and session factory
- **Graceful Degradation**: Logs errors and provides detailed error information

### 3. Connection Pool Management
- **Pre-ping**: Verifies connections before use
- **Pool Recycling**: Automatically recycles connections every hour
- **Overflow Handling**: Manages connection overflow gracefully
- **Invalid Connection Cleanup**: Removes invalid connections from pool

## Testing

### Test Script
Run the test script to verify the connection handling:

```bash
python test_connection_handling.py
```

This script tests:
- Database health checks
- Basic operations with retry logic
- Connection retry mechanisms
- Connection pool management

### Manual Testing
1. **Health Check**: `GET /health`
2. **Database Operations**: All existing endpoints now use the enhanced connection handling
3. **Connection Monitoring**: Check logs for retry attempts and connection recovery

## Monitoring and Logging

### Log Messages
The system now provides detailed logging for:
- Connection errors and retry attempts
- Connection health checks
- Pool status changes
- Reconnection attempts

### Example Log Output
```
2024-01-01 12:00:00 - WARNING - Database connection error (attempt 1/4): SSL SYSCALL error: EOF detected
2024-01-01 12:00:01 - INFO - Retrying in 1.23 seconds...
2024-01-01 12:00:01 - INFO - Attempting to reconnect to database...
2024-01-01 12:00:02 - INFO - Database reconnection successful
2024-01-01 12:00:02 - INFO - Database operation successful after retry
```

## Benefits

1. **Resilience**: Service continues running despite temporary connection issues
2. **Automatic Recovery**: No manual intervention required for connection problems
3. **Monitoring**: Comprehensive health checks and logging
4. **Configurability**: All retry parameters are configurable
5. **Performance**: Optimized connection pooling and reuse
6. **SSL Flexibility**: Configurable SSL settings for different environments

## Environment-Specific Configuration

### Development
```yaml
database:
  ssl_mode: "disable"
  max_retries: 1
  base_delay: 0.5
```

### Production
```yaml
database:
  ssl_mode: "require"
  max_retries: 5
  base_delay: 2.0
  max_delay: 120.0
```

### Cloud/Container
```yaml
database:
  ssl_mode: "prefer"
  pool_recycle: 1800  # 30 minutes
  connect_timeout: 60
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **SSL Certificate Problems**: Set `ssl_mode: "disable"` for testing
2. **Connection Timeouts**: Increase `connect_timeout` and `pool_timeout`
3. **Pool Exhaustion**: Increase `pool_size` and `max_overflow`
4. **Network Issues**: Increase `max_retries` and `max_delay`

### Debug Mode
Enable SQL debugging by setting `echo: True` in the engine configuration:

```python
self.engine = create_engine(
    db_url,
    echo=True,  # Enable SQL debugging
    # ... other parameters
)
```

This fix ensures your Discord SUI analyzer service will be resilient to database connection issues and automatically recover from temporary network problems or SSL connection errors.
